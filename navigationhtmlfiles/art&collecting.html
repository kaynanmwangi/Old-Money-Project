        <h2>Tips for Starting a Collection</h2>
        <p>
            <h4>Focus on Quality Over Quantity</h4>
            Old money collectors prioritize timeless pieces over trends—invest in a single, meaningful item rather than many lesser ones.
            <h4>Research Provenance</h4>
            Always verify the history of a piece; old money families value items with a story, like a painting once owned by a noble.
            <h4>Preservation Tips</h4>
            Store art in climate-controlled rooms to maintain its value, a practice common in old money estates.
